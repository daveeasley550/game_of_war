# game_of_war
project 2

the card game of war, only waaaaay faster(for you)

there are two player, you and the computer and one deck, shuffled and evenly distibuted.

each player draws their top card and the higher card wins

but what if there is a tie...well then there is WAR!

when war occurs, each player takes the top 3 cards and sets them aside, as a victory prize if you will, then each player draws another card from the top of their deck and the winner takes all, the initial draw, the victory prize and the second draw.

first player to get all the cards wins!
